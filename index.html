        <h1>Motivations</h1>
        <p>The American People decided to program this as a parody of the wildly popular game <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvE4TObNr8A"><i>Super Smash Brothers</i></a>, and of the election for President of the United States. As citizens of this beautiful nation, we have an oblication to think deeply regarding who our next president should be. However, we as a nation have a love of parodies in our blood, and a love of comedians competing for biggest laugh to bag the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zggPHzUb8-Q">White House</a>.</p>
        <p>We hope that the American People experience some respite from the idiosyncrasies of everyday life through the pure silliness of this parody.</p>

        <h2>lol that was fun, but let's be real for a moment</h2>

          <p>We at <i>Somnus Privatur</i> believe that the hackathon is special and should be treasured because it fosters a unique kind of <a href = "http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/12/12f8a8ac3a5fd4cbb85e60642d52d8d8781c700570d6503a3570ef9b7f736794.jpg">epistemology</a> amongst its followers. It sparks a kind of <a href = "https://sociologyofthefamily.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/class-consciousness.jpg">class conciousness</a> by uniting people of all races and all genders through the marvel of the computer, challenges participants to engage in fundamental (and arguably, revolutionary) <a href = "http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/8d/8d1930a04c7a106d394ef9dec255f9fb84959df9c40756d84ec7867497374e68.jpg">pedagogical</a> shifts in how one should view <a href = "https://twitter.com/bernieondebate/status/705594652477370368">society</a>, and when one is truly "grown up and knows his/her place". Ultimately, the hackathon is an affirmation of <a href = "https://i.imgflip.com/dso0c.jpg">equality, freedom, and fraternity</a>. Hence, this website is not aimed for any material benefit (e.g.an award)- this website (and its subsequent game) is a celebration of the achivements of the modern <a href = "http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/25/25733bc4fce87b9f8e84b51ab9dc991bedb2fb14f690b50d3e000dea04a37216.jpg">civilization</a>, and expresses all our hopes that the modern free spirit continue to live long and prosper.</p>

        <h1>Mechanics</h1>
          <h2>Programming Process</h2>
            <img src = "unity.png" style = "float: left; margin: 1em;"/>
            <p>The game was principally made using the popular Unity game engine. Using a combination of online resources (e.g. sprites), many different image editors, and a wide variety of Youtube tutorials, crafted a somewhat-successfull, but definitely punny program.</p>
            <p>The first thing we did was find sprites for the characters (Donald J. Drumpf, Hillary Clinton, Bernie "Feel the Bern" Sanders). We created relatively simple animations for our characters by making one of the characters' legs longer than the other, and by having the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ExuxDEXWgQ">computer</a> rapidly alternate between the two frames. This gave the illusion that the character was "walking."</p>
            <img src = "sprite.gif" class = "sprite"/>
            <p>Our efforts regarding animations focused more on the attacks/movements of the characters, because those animations are much more noticable than the one previously mentioned. To work on the rest of the project, we basically adapted various sprites into the Unity project. We adapted some sprites to create a few animations, as we had done for the characters' direct movements.</p>
            <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>This website was coded using HTML and CSS, and was hosted via Amazon Web Services</p>

            <img src = "giphy.gif" style = "float: left; width: 200px; height: 200px; margin: 1em;"/>
            <p>The game attempts to use imputs from a player keyboard (e.g. WASD) to move characters around the screen. They are able to deal damage to each other by "punching" (beams), but have specialized attacks for each specific character (for example, Trump has "build a wall"). Most of the ideas that were introduced in Smash were carried over (to a certain extent) to this game.</p>
            <p>Because of time constraints, we designed the game around one map. It is based off the <i>Battlefield</i> series of maps in the series because of its simple, easy-to-implement structure. The main difference is that we shifted the main balcony to the bottom of the screen.</p>
            <p>We also created our own start screen for the game that mimics the start screen of the Smash games, to comical effect (see top of the page).<p>
