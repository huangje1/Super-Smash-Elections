        <h1>Motivations</h1>
        <p>The American People decided to program this as a parody of the wildly popular game <i>Super Smash Brothers</i>, and of the election for President of the United States. As citizens of this beautiful nation, we have an oblication to think deeply regarding who our next president should be. However, we as a nation have a love of parodies in our blood.</p>
        <p>We hope that the American People experience some respite from the idiosyncrasies of everyday life through the pure silliness of this parody.</p>

        <h1>Mechanics</h1>
          <h2>Programming Process</h2>
            <p>The game was principally made using the popular Unity game engine. We used online resources, massive amounts of picture editors, and lots of plug-in Google searching to produce the game.</p>
            <p>The majority of the time was acquiring graphics/sprites to use for the project. Central on our minds were sprites of presidental candidates Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump. The characters' individual sprites were incredibly simple, as we simply had the program alternate between two sprites, where each sprite had a longer leg. This gave users an impression that the characters were dynamic.</p>
            <div class = "Sprites">
              <img src = "bernie.png" class = "spriteImgs"/>
              <img src = "trump.jpg" class = "spriteImgs"/>
              <img src = "hillary.png" class = "spriteImgs"/>
            </div>
            <p>Another major time-consuming section of the program was linking all the basic-level animations properly together. This was a problem that we couldn't finish in the final product because of time restraints.</p>
            <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>This website was coded using HTML and CSS, and was hosted via Amazon Web Services</p>
          <h2>Game Mechanics</h3>
            <p>The game attempts to use imputs from a player keyboard (e.g. WASD) to move characters around the screen. They are able to deal damage to each other by "punching" (beams), but have specialized attacks for each specific character (for example, Trump has "build a wall").</p>
            <p>Because of time constraints, we designed the game around one map. It is based off the <i>Battlefield</i> series of maps in the series because of its simple, easy-to-implement structure.</p>
            <p>In the final version of the game, the players were supposed to be hit with knockback that increases as damage increases (as the original series has it).<p>
